# Stack

This is a simple project based on the exercise **Tested Stack** from [DockYard Academy](https://github.com/matt-humphrey/DockYard-Academy).

The purpose of the project was to create a basic GenServer that simulates a stack, where you can push elements onto the top of the stack, and also pop off the top element, and to include a comprehensive test suite in ExUnit.
